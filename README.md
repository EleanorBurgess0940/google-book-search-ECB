# Unit 21 Mern Homework: google Book Search

In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

This activity was helped by some youtube videos by Jason Rivera and the link to those videos can be found here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35GZ6Q2QVEnV5IChbsThow and the series is called Build a Reactjs app with the Google Books API
